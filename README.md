# Frequently Asked Questions

* Where can I download the App?
    *  You can find the IDer app in your App Store or Google Play. Search for "ider".
* Can I hack/improve/fork/edit this plugin?
    *  Mmmm. Even though we encourage the developing and extension of new plugins it doesn't sound like a good idea in this case. This plugin has been very tested and stressed and it should be use as it is. But if you got a brilliant idea or suggestion we would love to hear from you.
